## Geometry

### Many Ways to Represent Geometry

### "Implicit"
- Based on classifying points
    - Points satisfy some specified relationship
    - E.g. sphere: all points in 3D, where x^2+y^2+z^2 = 1
- Sampling Can Be Hard
- Some tasks are hard with implicit representations.
- Implicit representations make some task easy.
- Pros:
    - compact description (e.g., a function)
    - certain queries easy (inside object, distance to surface)
    - good for ray-to-surface intersection (more later)
    - for simple shape, exact description / no sampling error
    - easy to handle changes 

### "Explicit" Representations of Geometry
- "Explicit"
- All points are **given directly** or **via parameter mapping**
- Sampling Is Easy
- Inside / Outside Test Hard

### No "Best" Representation - Geometry is Hard
"I hate meshes. I cannot believe how hard this is. Geometry is hard. 

### 根据任务类型决定用什么表示方法
### 计算机图形学中隐式更多一些

### Constructive Solid Geometry (Implicit)

### Distance Functions (Implicit)

### Fractals(分形)
- "Language" for describing natural phenomena Hard to control shape!
