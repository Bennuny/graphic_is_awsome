### Visible / occlusion
- Z-buffering

### Shading
- Illumination & Shading
- Graphics Pipeline

### Painter`s Algorithm
Inspired by how painters paint  
Paint from back to front, overwrite in the framebuffer.（油画家，层层覆盖）

### Z-Buffer
This is the algorithm that eventually won.  
Idea:
- Store current min. z-value for <u>each</u> sample (pixel)
- Needs an additional buffer for depth values
  - frame buffer stores color values
  - depth buffer (z-buffer) stores depth

```
  for (each triangle T)
    for (each sample (x,y,z) in T)
      if (z < zbuffer[x, y])      // closest sample so far
        framebuffer[x,y] = rgb;   // update color
        zbuffer[x,y] = z;         // updater z-buffer
      else
        ...
```

### Z-Buffer Complexity
- O(n) for n triangles (assuming constant coverage)
- How is it possible to sort n triangles in linear time?
- Drawing triangles in differents orders?
Most important visibility algorithm
- Implemented in hardware for all GPUs

### Shading: Definition
- In this course  
The process of applying a material to an object. 不同物品应用不同材质~

### A Simple Shading Model (Blinn-Phong Reflectance Model)
- Specular highlights   镜面反射(高光、物体比较光滑)
  - *观察方向* 和 *镜面反射* 方向足够接近
  - half vector near normal  (*半程向量* 解决 *法线*)
  - Cosine Power Plots (指数，控制高光有多大)
- Diffuse reflection    漫反射
  - Light is scattered uniformly in all directions
    - Surface color is the same for all viewing direction
  - But how much light (energy) is received
    - *Lambert`s cosine law*
- Ambient lighting      环境光照
  - Add constant color to account for disregarded illumination and fill in black shadows
  - This is approximate / fake!

### Shading is Local [p7.53`]
Compute light reflected toward camera at a specific <font color='red'> shading point </font>.  
Inputs:
- shading point
- Viewer direction, v
- Surface normal, n
- Light direction, l (for each of many lights)
- Surface parameters (color, shininess)

### Shading Frequencies
What caused the shading difference?
- 低多边形动画，可以降低着色频率

**Flat** shading
- Triangle face is flat - one normal vector
- Not good for smooth surfaces

**Gouraud** shading
- Interpolate colors from vertices across triangle
- Each vertex has normal vector (how?)

**Phone** shading
- Interpolate normal vectors across each triangle
- Compute full shading model at each pixel
- Not the Blinn-Phong Reflectance Model 

### Defining Per-Vertex Normal Vectors
Best to get vertex normals from the underlying geometry
- e.g. consider a shpere

Otherwise have to infer vertex normals from triangle face
- Simple scheme: **average surrounding face normals**

No shadows will be generated! (shading != shadow)
$$
L_d = k_d(I/r^2)max(0,n·1)
$$
Ld: diffuselyreflected light
kd: diffuse coefficient (color)
I/r^2: energy arrived at the shading point
max(0, n·1): energy received by the shading point

### Shader Programs
- Program vertex and fragment processing stages
- Describe operation on a single vertex (or fragment)
- 逐顶点、逐像素运行

- Shader function executes once per fragment.
- Outputs color of surface at the current fragment`s screen sample position.
- This shader performs a texture lookup to obtain the surface`s material color at this point, then performs a diffuse lighting calculation.

- GLSL

### Texture Mapping
纹理坐标: Each triangle vertex is assigned a texture coordinate *(u, v)*
```
  u, v范围: [0, 1]
```
